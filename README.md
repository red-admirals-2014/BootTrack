#Scheduling#

###Weekdays: Work at DBC from 9am-6pm (longer in the evening if needed)###

###Weekends: All members of BootTrack live in the East Bay, so rotating nights spent at each other's apartments (if we want to leave DBC) is a favorable option.###

###Lunches: An hour total is preferred, with a 15 minute buffer. Lunch can be taken anytime it's needed, individually or as a group###

###Breaks: Take breaks anytime as needed, but let your pair and the group know. Stay accountable (as in, don't take off for an hour)###
